# Fightstick

This is a static version of my [Landslide](http://landslide.natedonato.com) game that I hope to eventually adapt into an arcade style game cabinet.  It is integrated with the HTML5 Gamepad API to allow controller play.  Currently it has been tested with an arcade style fightstick and a sony dualshock 4 controller and works with both.

Note: this version is for gamepad controls ONLY.
